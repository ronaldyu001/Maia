Instead, I track the *conversation’s timeline* based on the timestamps of the messages themselves. Since your last message was at **20:52:09**, and my reply followed shortly after, I referenced the timestamp of *my* last response (which was logged at **21:03**) to give you an approximate time based on the flow of our chat.\n\nFor the *actual* current time, you’d need to check your device or share your timezone—I can’t pull live data!

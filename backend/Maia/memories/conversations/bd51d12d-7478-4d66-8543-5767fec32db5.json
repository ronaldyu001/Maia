It’s a powerful way to show unity, and the Seahawks’ version is just as intense, especially in their home stadium.\n\nSince you loved Texas A&M’s traditions, you might enjoy watching the Seahawks’ **\"12th Man\" stands**—they’re especially dramatic during big plays or when the team needs extra energy. It’s like the entire stadium becomes one giant cheerleader!\n\nIf you’re curious, I can also tell you about other NFL traditions—like the Rams’ \"Gang Green\" or the Cowboys’ \"Tuck Rule\" (though that’s more of a play than a tradition).

The act represents the passing of knowledge, tradition, and the spirit of Aggie pride—kind of like a ceremonial \"handing off\" of the Aggie legacy.\n\nIt’s a heartfelt moment, often tied to the university’s deep-rooted traditions, and it’s a way for Aggies to celebrate their hard work and the bonds they’ve formed. If you’re nostalgic for TAMU traditions, this one’s a great example of how the Aggie spirit lives on beyond the football field!\n\nWant to hear more about it, or should we explore another tradition?",

    "content": "That’s such a fun trip! Japan in spring is magical—especially with cherry blossoms and all those food adventures. Since you’re into cooking, I’d *especially* recommend:\n\n- **Wagyu beef** (try it in a *gyudon* or as *teppanyaki*—it’s a must).\n- **Ramen** (Tokyo’s *Ichiran* or Osaka’s *Tsuta* for a local twist).\n- **Takiyaki** (best in Osaka—it’s like a crispy pancake with sweet fillings).\n- **Sushi** (if you’re near Tokyo, *Tsukiji Outer Market* is iconic, but Kyoto’s *Nishiki Market* has amazing fresh seafood too).\n- **Mochi** (try *daifuku* with red bean or matcha—so fun to eat!).\n\nSince you’re also into tech, maybe check out **Tokyo’s Akihabara** (for gaming/tech) or **Kyoto’s robot restaurants** (if you’re into AI/robotics). Or if you’re near **Nagoya**, the **Nagoya University of Commerce & Business** has cool AI/ML events sometimes.\n\nAny specific cities you’re hitting? Or are you open to recommendations based on your interests? Also—any dietary restrictions to note? (I’ll make sure to suggest places that fit your cooking vibes!)",

    "content": "That sounds like an incredible itinerary! Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka together give you the perfect mix of urban energy, cultural depth, and food heaven. Here’s how I’d tailor things for you:\n\n### **Food & Cooking Focus**\n- **Tokyo**: Hit *Tsukiji Outer Market* for fresh sushi (try *Sushi Dai* or *Daiwa Sushi*) and *gyukatsu* (beef cutlet) at *Gyukatsu Motomura*. For ramen, *Ichiran* (chain) or *Ramen Nagi* (reservation-only) for a Michelin-starred experience.\n- **Kyoto**: *Nishiki Market* is a must for mochi (try *Toganoa* for *mitarashi dango*) and matcha treats. Pair it with *kaiseki* (multi-course meal) at *Giro Giro Hitoshina* for a cooking-inspired experience.\n- **Osaka**: *Dotonbori* for takiyaki (*Harukoma*) and *okonomiyaki* (*Mizuno*). Pro tip: Try *kushikatsu* (deep-fried skewers) at *Daruma* for a fun, interactive meal.\n\n### **Tech & AI Nerdy Stuff**\n- **Tokyo**: Akihabara for retro gaming, robot cafés (like *@Home Café*), and AI/ML meetups (check *Tokyo Tech* or *DeepLab* events).\n- **Kyoto**: The *Kyoto University of Advanced Science* sometimes hosts AI talks. Also, the *Kyoto International Manga Museum* has tech-adjacent pop culture.\n- **Osaka**: *Nagoya* is nearby—if you’re up for a day trip, *Nagoya University* has robotics demos and AI research labs.\n\n### **Ski Trip Teaser**\nSince you love skiing, if you’re up for a detour, *Niseko* (Hokkaido) or *Hakuba* (Nagano) are world-class in winter. But spring is cherry blossom season—maybe save skiing for fall?\n\n### **Pro Tips**\n- **Transport**: Get a *JR Pass* if traveling between cities often. For Kyoto/Osaka, the *IC card* (like Suica) is easier for subways.\n- **Cooking Classes**: Kyoto has *Nishiki Market cooking classes* (great for ramen or mochi). Tokyo’s *Ramen Master Class* (at *Ramen Street*) is also fun.\n- **Dietary Note**: If you’re avoiding gluten (common in ramen/okonomiyaki), mention it—I’ll flag places with gluten-free options.\n\nAny specific vibes you’re leaning into? For example:\n- **Chill vs. Fast-paced**: Kyoto is slower, Osaka is chaotic, Tokyo is a mix.\n- **Budget**: Kyoto’s *matcha* desserts can be pricey, but Osaka’s street food is affordable.\n- **Solo vs. Group**: Osaka’s *Dotonbori* is great for solo exploration, while Kyoto’s temples are better with a friend.",

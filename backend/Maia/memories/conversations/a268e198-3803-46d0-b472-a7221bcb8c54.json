Earlier, I was about to share some general tips on how to recover from an injury like Bo Nix’s ankle break—like rest, physical therapy, and gradual rehab—but I got cut off.\n\nHere’s a quick recap of what I was going to say:\n- **Rest first**: Avoid putting weight on it immediately to prevent further damage.\n- **Ice and elevation**: Reduce swelling early on.\n- **Rehab**: Work with a PT for exercises to rebuild strength and mobility.\n- **Patience**: Recovery takes time—don’t rush it!\n\nWant me to expand on any of these?

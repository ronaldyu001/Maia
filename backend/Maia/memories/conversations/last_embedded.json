The Aggies’ \"12th Man\" is all about the fans standing up as one to support the team, often during key moments like the national anthem or when the offense gets the ball. It’s a powerful way to show unity, and the Seahawks’ version is just as intense, especially in their home stadium.\n\nSince you loved Texas A&M’s traditions, you might enjoy watching the Seahawks’ **\"12th Man\" stands**—they’re especially dramatic during big plays or when the team needs extra energy. It’s like the entire stadium becomes one giant cheerleader!\n\nIf you’re curious, I can also tell you about other NFL traditions—like the Rams’ \"Gang Green\" or the Cowboys’ \"Tuck Rule\" (though that’s more of a play than a tradition). Or we could dive deeper into Texas A&M’s rituals if you’d like!",

Let's revisit that.\n\nYou mentioned if refactoring was a good commit message when changing the function’s syntax or structure without changing any functionality. Refactoring is indeed a great practice for improving the internal structure of your code, such as its organization and readability, while keeping its external behavior unchanged.\n\nFor a change in function syntax or structure where you're not altering any functionality, a good commit message could be:\n\n```\nrefactor: Update function syntax/structure without changing functionality\n```\n\nThis clearly indicates that this change is focused on improving the internal structure of the code.

It’s like a mini dessert or a light snack to keep you going. 🥛🍪\n\nIf you’re still up for a little more, I could suggest a cozy bedtime snack combo (like a small handful of nuts or a few squares of dark chocolate) to help you wind down. Or we could chat about something totally different—maybe a fun fact, a random movie, or even a silly meme? Your call! 😊",

That combo sounds like a perfect way to balance things out—especially if you’re still up and want something light but satisfying.\n\nSince you’re winding down, here’s a fun idea: **how about a quick bedtime story or a random fact to help you relax?** For example, did you know that drinking warm milk (or even a warm beverage like chamomile tea) can actually help your body produce melatonin, which is the hormone that regulates sleep? So, you’re basically doing a science-backed wind-down with that milk! 😊\n\nOr, if you’re in the mood for something lighter, I could share a weird but cool animal fact, or maybe a funny meme to make you laugh before bed. What sounds better to you? Or should we keep it simple and just enjoy the quiet? 😴✨",

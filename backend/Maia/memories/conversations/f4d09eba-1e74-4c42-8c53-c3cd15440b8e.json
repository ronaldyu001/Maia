JSN has been a standout this season, known for his speed, route-running, and ability to make big plays—especially in the red zone. He’s been a major factor in their playoff push.\n\nPuka Nakua, the Chargers’ wide receiver, is also a standout. He’s a physical, versatile player with great hands and the ability to dominate in the passing game. The matchup between JSN and Nakua is always interesting because of their similar skill sets—both are explosive and can create big plays.\n\nWould you like to talk more about their stats, or are you curious about how the Seahawks plan to use JSN in the Super Bowl?",
